This is a little game I made for fun, suitable for mobile devices.

The aim of this game is reproducing the shown sequence of colours as long as You can.

To know about the API read the comments.

### Development

    Install Ruby >= 1.9 and Node.JS >= 0.10 (i'm using that one) if you don't have them on your machine (You should, they are awesome :).

    From the terminal:
    +   `cd path/to/colour-memo`
    +   `npm install`
    +   `gem install bundle`
    +   `bundle`


### Test

I'm testing with [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/index.html).

### TODO

* Add tests :P
